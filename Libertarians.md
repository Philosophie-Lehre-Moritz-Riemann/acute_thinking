## Two faces of Libertarianism: Robert Nozick v. Ayn Rand

### Henry David Thoreau

>"I heartily accept the motto, -- "That Government is best which governs least;" and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which I also believe, -- "That government is best which governs not at all;" and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government they will have." 

>"If the injustice is part of the necessary friction of the machine of government, let it go, let it go; perchance it will wear smooth—certainly the machine will wear out. If the injustice has a spring, or a pulley, or a rope, or a crank, exclusively for itself, then perhaps you may consider whether the remedy will not be worse than the evil; but if it is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another, then I say, break the law. Let your life be a counter-friction to stop the machine. What I have to do is to see, at any rate, that I do not lend myself to the wrong which I condemn." (Civil Disobedience)


### Robert Nozick

>"An ultraminimal state maintains a monopoly over all use use of force except that necessary in immediate self-defense, and so excludes private (or agency) retaliation for wrong and exaction of compensation; but it provides protection and enforcement only to those who purchase its protection and enforcement policies." (Anarchy, State, and Utopia 26)


>"The minimal state treats us as individuals, who may not be used in certain ways by others as means or tools or instruments or ressources; it treats us as persons having individual rights with the dignity this constitutes. [...] How dare any state or group of individuals do more. Or less." (Anarchy, State, and Utopia 26)

### Ayn Rand

>"There is no difference between communism and socialism, except in the means of achieving the same ultimate end: communism proposes to enslave men by force, socialism - by vote. It is merely the difference between murder and suicide." (The Los Angeles times, Sept. 9, 1962)

>"There is, however, one difference between the type of fascism toward we are drifting and the type that ravaged European countries: ours is not a militant kind of fascism, not an organized movement of shrill demagogues, bloody thugs, hysterical third rate intellectuals, and juvenile delinquents – ours is a tired, worn, cynical fascism, fascism by default, not a flaming disaster, but more like the quiet collapse of a lethargic body slowly eaten by internal corruption" (Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal 220)

## Variations

### Cyber-Libertarianism

John Perry Barlow, former Songwriter for the Greatful Dead: The Declaration of Independence of the Cyberspace

>"Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather. We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address you with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always speaks. I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear."

>You claim there are problems among us that you need to solve. You use this claim as an excuse to invade our precincts. Many of these problems don't exist. Where there are real conflicts, where there are wrongs, we will identify them and address them by our means. We are forming our own Social Contract. This governance will arise according to the conditions of our world, not yours. Our world is different. Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live.
>
>We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth. We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity. Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context do not apply to us. They are all based on matter, and there is no matter here. [...] Your increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate themselves by proposing laws, in America and elsewhere, that claim to own speech itself throughout the world. These laws would declare ideas to be another industrial product, no more noble than pig iron. In our world, whatever the human mind may create can be reproduced and distributed infinitely at no cost. The global conveyance of thought no longer requires your factories to accomplish.

### Paleolibertarism

Murray Rothbard 

Llewellyn Harrison Rockwell: "The Case for Paleo-Libertarianism" (1990)

>"Pornographic photography, "free"thinking, chaotic painting, atonal music, deconstructionist literature, Bauhaus architecture, and modernist films have nothing in common with the libertarian political agenda-no matter how much individual libertarians may revel in them. In addition to their aesthetic and moral disabilities, these "art forms" are political liabilities outside Berkeley and Greenwich Village."

>"Most Americans despise civil rights and rightly so. At one time, civil rights "meant the rights of the citizen against the State," says Sobran. Now "it means favored treatment for blacks (or some other minority) at the expense of everyone else." [...]

>"State-enforced segregation, which also violated property rights, was wrong, but so is State-enforced integration. State enforced segregation was not wrong because separateness is wrong, however. Wishing to associate with members of one's own race, nationality, religion, class, sex, or even political party is a natural and normal human impulse. A voluntary society will therefore have male organizations, Polish neighborhoods, black churches, Jewish country clubs, and white fraternities. When the State abolishes the right of free association, it creates not social peace but discord."

>"There is nothing wrong with blacks preferring the "black thing." But paleolibertarians would say the same about whites preferring the "white thing" or Asians the "Asian thing.""

>"Libertarians can and must talk again with the resurgent paleoconservatives, now in the process of breaking away from the neocons. [...] Together, paleolibertarians and paleoconservatives can rebuild the great antiwelfare state, anti-interventionist coalition that thrived before World War II and survived through the Korean War. [...] Some will find this painful; I'm looking forward to it. Let the cleansing process begin – it is long past due."

### Peter Thiel

>"I remain committed to the faith of my teenage years: to authentic human freedom as a precondition for the highest good. I stand against confiscatory taxes, totalitarian collectives, and the ideology of the inevitability of the death of every individual. For all these reasons, I still call myself “libertarian.” But I must confess that over the last two decades, I have changed radically on the question of how to achieve these goals. Most importantly, I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible. By tracing out the development of my thinking, I hope to frame some of the challenges faced by all classical liberals today."
